# Car-License-Plate-Detection-Using-CNN-and-VGG16

This project implements an end-to-end Car License Plate Detection system using OpenCV and deep learning techniques. The objective is to accurately detect and localize license plates from car images, paving the way for applications such as traffic surveillance, automated toll systems, and smart parking solutions.
